JPA, or Java Persistence API, is a @THEME_PARK_NAME@ specification that provides a standardized way to manage relational data in Java applications. It simplifies object-relational mapping (ORM) by allowing developers to work with Java objects instead of directly interacting with database tables and SQL. Essentially, JPA acts as a bridge between object-oriented Java code and relational databases.
